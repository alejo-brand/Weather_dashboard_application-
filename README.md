# Weather_dashboard_application-

in this application the user will be able to get access to weather information from all over the world by searching a city that they are interested in knowing th current weather as well as the next 5 days weather forecast.

By this search the user will be able to know variables like Temperature, Humidity, UV index and wind speed in the specific location they searched for.

In this project I used the Openweather API and some different endpoints such as current weather data, UV index and 5 day/3 hour forecast.

Here you will be able to take a look at how the actual app looks like and at the bottom of this page you'll finde links to the live website and the gitHub repository.
